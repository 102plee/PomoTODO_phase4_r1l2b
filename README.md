# CPSC 210 Personal Project (Pseudo POMOTDO)

Personal project made for CPSC 210. Features a TODO list that is customizable with a date and description. GUI is available as well, 
supplied with the JavaFX library. The GUI structure was supplied by the course instructors, with core pieces left out. The main functionality
was required to be programmed in.

The program saves the TODO list into a JSON file, which it then parses whenever required.
